Other solutions that I deliver range from executive dashboards, to full-stack custom solutions for scheduling of operational teams, embedded analytics on public and private websites / platforms, and more. 
<br></br>

My clients range from Fortune 500 enterprise consumer goods companies to industry leading SaaS logistics platforms, eCommerce Technology Series A startups, and privately held clean energy industry leaders. 
<br></br>

Having leveraged data to deliver value to C-suite decision making, ground level operational efficiency, compliance tracking and enforcement, and customer facing platform experience - I am a seasoned veteran when it comes to identifying and leveraging the value captured in your teamâ€™s data.
